            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isn't HTML easy? I'm sure you know a lot about HTML, Web Browser. Especially because you are the one displaying it to me.
            <!--for line break -->

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey Web Browser, let me tell you a bot more about HTML.We can also do special characters inside HTML.
            <br/>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, to do a less-than sign, we need to enclose it inside an &amp; followed by its special HTML character map &lt; finally ended by a ;
        </p>
        <p>
             &mu;, &lambda;, &delta;, &Delta;, and other Greek characters make for great special characters.
        </p>

        <p>Sincerely,</p>
